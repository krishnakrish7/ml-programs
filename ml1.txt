supevised:----classification(yes or no)
	      regression(output is in continous range)
unsupervised----clustering




3types of business problems
1)classifiction---knn algorithm---used to predict the accuracy
	       ---naive bayes algorithm
2)regression--used to know the error-simple linear algorithm--
3)clustering---kmeans algorithm


algorithm is nothing but set of rules and regulations
based on stastics.

knn algorithm:--k nearest neighbor algorithm
distance between two points
simplest algorithm also known as lazy algorithm
